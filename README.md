# Cookie Clicker (C++, SDL)

## Summary
This Game is a simple cookie clicker, you click on the cookie and you gain a cookie, Indulge in the satisfying feeling of rapidly clicking on those scrumptious treats, and with each click, witness your cookie collection multiply.
 In this game, you are the master of your own cookie empire, Your mission is simple: click on the big cookie that is on the screen using your trusty mouse and watch as your cookie count grows exponentially.

## Design Patterns

### Pattern 1
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that when one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. 
It enables loose coupling between the subject and its observers, promoting flexibility and maintainability in the software design.
The observer pattern has several advantages, such as promoting modularity and reusability, supporting dynamic and flexible behavior, and enabling parallel and asynchronous processing.


## Noteworthy C++ Features

### Feature 1
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code is structured using classes to encapsulate data and behavior related to different entities. 
For example, Window, Image, and Font are classes that abstract the SDL window, image loading, and font loading functionality, respectively. OOP allows for better organization and modularity in the code.

### Feature 2
SDL Event Handling: The code demonstrates event-driven programming using the SDL event loop. 
It processes various types of events, such as SDL_QUIT, SDL_MOUSEMOTION, and SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN. 
This way, the application can respond to user input and control program flow accordingly.

## Challenges
My biggest challenge during this assignment was the issue of rendering text, it took some time and caused me the most delay.
In the end with the help of a friend, I managed to make it work the way I intended.
Another challenge I had to face was using a design pattern due to not knowing much, if anything about them.

## Learnings
I learned a lot during this project, mainly how to work in SDL in general.
Additionally, I have delved into C++ programming, exploring various concepts and techniques, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) and other C++ features.
